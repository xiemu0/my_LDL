run env: python 3.6.3<br><br>
algs.gd_ldl_scl.py:<br>
The algorithm was proposed in my paper, i.e., "***Xiang Zheng**, Xiuyi Jia, and Weiwei li. Label distribution learning by
exploiting sample correlations locally. In: AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, New Orleans, LA, USA, 2018,
pp. 4556â€“4563*."<br><br>
algs.sgd_adam_ldl_sal.py:<br>
The extension version of the above paper, and it extends the algorithm with the Adam algorithm. The paper has been submitted
to *IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics*.<br><br>
algs.edl.py and algs.lld_bfgs.py are two algorithms compared with our methods, which are implemented with python.
